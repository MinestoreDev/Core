# Minestore | Core
This is the core repository for Minestore, if your looking for the API or anything else head back to our [profile page](https://github.com/MinestoreDev/) and take another look :wink:

-

This repository contains the actual Minestore code, including the UI, most of the API and Minecraft connections,
and a few other bits. If you need the admin panel code, it might be best to check out [this repository](https://github.com/MinestoreDev/AdminPanel) :3
